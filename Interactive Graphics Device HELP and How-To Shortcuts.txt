¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 an open-source R script by Marc Laurencelle, alias marQIsoft
largely based on R example code for getGraphicsEvent function

==================== Keyboard shortcuts: ====================

ESC, Q, CTRL+[
  To end interaction with the active graph

A, =, +
  To zoom in globally (x & y simultaneously)

Z, -
  To zoom out globally (x & y simultaneously)

6 / 4 (ideally keys from the numeric keypad)
  To zoom in/out horizontally (along x) only

8 / 2 (ideally keys from the numeric keypad)
  To zoom in/out vertically (along y) only

CTRL+L
  To restore the last ~stable x&y view range

V
  To change the vertical exaggeration ratio

X / Y
  To set the central X/Y coordinate of the view range

RIGHT / LEFT / UP / DOWN
  To move the view range in the desired direction

R, 0
  To reset (restore) the zoom to the initial view

====================== Mouse actions: =======================

CLICK & DRAG
  To move the view range freely using the mouse

CLICK ONLY
  To recenter the view at the clicked x,y location
  and display that location's x,y coordinates

!REMARK!
  Due to limited reliability of R-Graphics devices'
  mouse event management, mouse-up events are often
  missed by R's GraphicsEventHandlers, which results
  in frequent unwanted moves of the x&y view range.
  I hope this issue will eventually be solved in a
  future release of R.
